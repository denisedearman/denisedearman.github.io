It's time!!!


For what?


The first of many learn projects.



The project portion of the FIS curriculum is something I have been looking forward to. Okay... and a little nervous about because the structure and instructions are a little bit more sparse than a typical lab.


However, with this lack of structure comes an opportunity for creativity and dare I say adventure? 


The outline for the CLI Gem Project is to create an object-oriented ruby app that scrapes a website (or multiple websites) for content and delivers this content to users via the CLI (command-line interface). The scraping has to be more than one level deep (typically the first level of scraping gets a list of items and the second level returns the details of these items).

In brainstorming I came up with an idea that I think would be quite fun: a wine information app. It's somewhat inspired by the documentary Somm that I recently watched.

My idea is that a user would be prompted with a list of wine regions that have been scraped from a website to select from. Then from this first selection the app will get data about the wine region. I am hoping to add a third level detail with a selection of wines from that region that you could select on and get more details about that wine. 


There is a lot more planning and coding to come on this project! I'll be blogging again about this project once I have more of it complete.


# The Marathon Front

The past few weeks I have been upping my miles to build my marathon training "base". Last week I had my first major hiccup in training. I ran a 10k on Saturday a little too hard and on Sunday I woke up with a painful left ankle. I decided to not run my Sunday miles and luckily that did the trick. On Monday I woke up with 0 pain in the ankle and feeling refreshed. 

Sometimes its hard for me to decide that I need a day off (from work or running). However, it seems that most of the time take the time off when its really needed is more helpful than trying to run when your body is telling you it needs rest. 

This week has been a successful week of training. Assuming all goes well over the weekend I will hit my goal of 30 miles this week.
