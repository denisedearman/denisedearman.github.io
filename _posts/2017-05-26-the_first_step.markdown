Taking the first step of any journey can be intimidating and scary. This past weekend while attending a friend's graduation for Fordham I was able to hear a particularly poignant speech by Chuck Schumer. To summarize, Senator Schumer's advice was: Go for it! The world we live in today can seem like a black hole of uncertainty. The trick is to embrace this uncertainty and see the unlimited opportunities and possibilities that it provides. 

I hope to keep this attitude throughout my FIS journey and beyond!

# About My Blog
This blog will cover two of my passions: running and coding. I am currently a student in the FIS Online Web Development Program and just starting my training for the NYC Marathon. It will serve as a technical blog and training log in one. 

# How I Got To This Point, Why Learn Web Development? 

When I first decided that I wanted to learn how to code I was a sophomore in college. I signed up for an Intro to CS in Java after a suggestion from my mom. From the first assignment I was hooked. It was not an easy journey through the rest of my college years. Because I had switched majors relatively late I had to take a heavier load of courses in order to complete my degree. Nevertheless in 2015 I graduated with a degree in Computer Science.

After completeing school I immediately started a job in the consulting industry as a software engineer. Over the past 2 years I have gained a lot of experience with backend data processing and SQL. In thinking about my next career move, I began feeling like I did not just want another job. I want something more. 

Web development is almost entirely new to me and something not in my current skillset. I would love to have ability to create functioning web apps that can interact in functional, intuitive, and even beautiful ways.  But where to start? After finding out about FIS and researching more about the curriculum and the environment, I knew that it could be a great bridge between where I am today and where I hope to go.

# How I Got To This Point Version 2, Why Run the NYC Marathon

For the majority of my life I hated running. I do not joke when I say that I used to dread playing tag as a kid because of the running involved. 

As a volleyball player for over 10 years, running was only used as a punishment and anyone who tried to run outside of the "punishments" dolled out during practice was discouraged from doing so with the warning "It will make you slow".

One day after my volleyball career had come to a close, one of my friends who enjoyed running decided to drag me on a run outside. The first few runs were horrible. A minute into the run I felt like I was going to die. However, on one beautiful afternoon I decided to just go slow. On this "slow" run I was able to go 2 miles (a major win for me)!! Pretty soon I was able to run 5 miles! 

In 2014 I went to watch a friend run the NYC Marathon. Seeing her round the corner of Columbus Circle towards the finish line I had a crazy thought: I want to run a marathon. It was a crazy idea and I put it on the backburner for a while, but the desire never diminished. 

In 2015 I ran my first half marathon. Upon finishing, I decided that 2016 would be the year for my first full marathon. Unable to get into the NYC marathon for 2016 I decided upon the Portland marathon. After a hot and hard summer of training I completed my first marathon! It was one of the best days ever.

In 2017 I have set my sights of the NYC Marathon because it is such a fantastic atmosphere and course. Having gotten into the marathon via the 9 + 1 program, all I have to do now is put in the hard work of training!
