Happy Tuesday!

I just started my first full time week of FIS after spending 2 months part-time (and therefore almost no-time).

After finishing the HTML/CSS unit I felt that it might be a good idea to recap some of the important takeaways from this section.

Having worked very briefly with HTML and CSS prior to the program, I was very happy to be able to clear up a lot of the confusion that I had. 

Here are my general major takeaways from this unit:

**1. Organization will make your life much easier.**
CSS can get confusing and messy quite quickly. Pick descriptive id and class names. Organize your rules and style sheets.

**2. Understand the selector hierarchy.**

- The broadest selector properties will be replaced with any more specific properties (if the more specific selector contains a - rule for that particular property).
- From least specific to most specific: **elements** -> **classes/attributes** -> **ids** -> **in-line**
- You can add a less specific selector to a more specific selector and make it more specific: 
  Ex. p#id is more specific than #id

**3. Media queries are your responsive friend**
 - Media queries allow you to change CSS rules as the user's screen size changes. Being able to set the width to 90% in your media query will mean that all of your elements under that rule will automatically update in width!!!
 - It seems that the media queries take trial and error to develop. Chrome's dev tools are a nice help with this to check the exact widths in which your layout breaks down.

**4. Bootstrap is convenient**

- Bootstrap is a framework that provides lots of basic styling, media queries and JS add ons. Depending on the content these styles and responsive rules may not work or make any sense!
- The Bootstrap design is based on a 12 unit wide grid per row. The Bootstrap classes "col-size-span" (ex. col-sm-8) are used to set the size of a column in a row and to set when the columns should collapse and appear vertically. The smallest size xs will never have its columns collapse and be viewed veritcally. 


# Running
Last week I completed my goal of 24 miles for the week! I also ran 6 days in a row which is something I have not done since training for my last marathon.
I have been base building miles to start my official 18 week training plan for the NYC marathon the week of July 4th. However, my training plan doesnt really get into the workouts until about 4-5 weeks in. So I am planning out how to adjust the plan to give me a gentler ease into the workouts. 

**This week my goal is 26 miles:**

Mon: 4 - done.
Tues: 3 - done.
Wed: off
Thurs: 4
Fri: 3
Sat: 5
Sun: 7



**That's all for now,**
